       script - make typescript of terminal session[m
[m
[1mSYNOPSIS[0m[m
       [1mscript[0m [options] [[4mfile[24m][m
[m
[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       [1mscript[0m makes a typescript of everything on your terminal session. The terminal data are stored in raw form to the log file and information about timing to another (optional) structured log file. The[m
       timing log file is necessary to replay the session later by [1mscriptreplay[0m(1) and to store additional information about the session.[m
[m
       Since version 2.35, [1mscript[0m supports multiple streams and allows the logging of input and output to separate files or all the one file. This version also supports new timing file which records[m
       additional information. The command [1mscriptreplay[0m [1m--summary[0m then provides all the information.[m
[m
       If the argument [4mfile[24m or option [1m--log-out[0m [4mfile[24m is given, [1mscript[0m saves the dialogue in this [4mfile[24m. If no filename is given, the dialogue is saved in the file [4mtypescript[24m.[m
[m
       Note that logging input using [1m--log-in[0m or [1m--log-io[0m may record security-sensitive information as the log file contains all terminal session input (e.g., passwords) independently of the terminal echo[m
       flag setting.[m
[m
[1mOPTIONS[0m[m
       Below, the [4msize[24m argument may be followed by the multiplicative suffixes KiB (=1024), MiB (=1024*1024), and so on for GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB (the "iB" is optional, e.g., "K" has the same[m
       meaning as "KiB"), or the suffixes KB (=1000), MB (=1000*1000), and so on for GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB and YB.[m
[m
       [1m-a[0m, [1m--append[0m[m
           Append the output to [4mfile[24m or to [4mtypescript[24m, retaining the prior contents.[m
[m
       [1m-c[0m, [1m--command[0m [4mcommand[24m[m
           Run the [4mcommand[24m rather than an interactive shell. This makes it easy for a script to capture the output of a program that behaves differently when its stdout is not a tty.[m
[m
       [1m-E[0m, [1m--echo[0m [4mwhen[24m[m
           This option controls the [1mECHO[0m flag for the slave end of the sessionâ€™s pseudoterminal. The supported modes are [4malways[24m, [4mnever[24m, or [4mauto[24m.[m
[m
           The default is [4mauto[24m â€” in this case, [1mECHO[0m enabled for the pseudoterminal slave; if the current standard input is a terminal, [1mECHO[0m is disabled for it to prevent double echo; if the current[m
           standard input is not a terminal (for example pipe: [1mecho[0m [1mdate[0m [1m|[0m [1mscript[0m) then keeping [1mECHO[0m enabled for the pseudoterminal slave enables the standard input data to be viewed on screen while being[m
           recorded to session log simultaneously.[m
[m
           Note that 'never' mode affects content of the session output log, because users input is not repeated on output.[m
[m
       [1m-e[0m, [1m--return[0m[m
           Return the exit status of the child process. Uses the same format as bash termination on signal termination (i.e., exit status is 128 + the signal number). The exit status of the child process[m
           is always stored in the type script file too.[m
[m
       [1m-f[0m, [1m--flush[0m[m
           Flush output after each write. This is nice for telecooperation: one person does [1mmkfifo[0m [1mfoo;[0m [1mscript[0m [1m-f[0m [1mfoo[0m, and another can supervise in real-time what is being done using [1mcat[0m [1mfoo[0m. Note that[m
           flush has an impact on performance; itâ€™s possible to use [1mSIGUSR1[0m to flush logs on demand.[m
[m
       [1m--force[0m[m
           Allow the default output file [4mtypescript[24m to be a hard or symbolic link. The command will follow a symbolic link.[m
